Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the computing group at ALS of [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2023. 

I have a deep passion for machine learning and software engineering, with a particular focus on their applications within the field of materials science. My passion lies in the application of these skills to solve complex challenges in materials domain. I am eager to collaborate with colleagues and contribute to meaningful projects that can drive innovation and progress in my current role.
