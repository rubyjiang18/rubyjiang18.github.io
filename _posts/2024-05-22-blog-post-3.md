### <span style="font-size:smaller; color:LightCoral">Eposide 1</span> THE CALL TO ADCENTURE

Before we wegin, let me just establish the fact that I don;t know much relative to what I need to know. Whatever success I've had in life has had more to do with my knowing how to deal with  my not knowing than anything I know. That I should be telling other people what to do sounds kind of presumptuous to me. But I'm going to do it because I believe that the principles that have made me successful could help others achieve their own goals. I'm now at the stage in my own life in which it is much more important to me to pass along what I've learned about how to be successful than to seek more success for myself. What you choose to do with these principles is up to you. You have to be an independent thinker, because only you can develop your own principles based on your own values. This brings me to my first and most foundamental principle, which is that 
> **You need to think for yourself about what is true.** 
So let's get started. Early on I discovered I needed principles. <u>Principles are smart ways for handling things that happen over and over again in similar situations.</u> There are principles for everything, from skiing to parenting to cooking and so on. I'm going to share some of my most importantï¼Œ overarching, life principles that influence how we approach everything that we do.

I didn't start out with principles. <u>I acquired them over a lifetime of experiences, mostly from making mistakes and reflecting on them.</u> My life principles are simple, but they're not complete.
