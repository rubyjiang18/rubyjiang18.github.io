***The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a Fck*** by Mark Manson

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">What determines your success isn't, "What do you want to enjoy?" The relevant question is, "What pain do you want to sustain?" The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">See: it's a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you're allowed to stop climbing, I'm afraid you're missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.</p>

***How to Win Friends & Influence People*** by Dale Carnegie

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">..., after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the most about engineering...

Personal Finance

***You Are a Badass at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth*** by Jen Sincero

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">A healthy desire for wealth is not greed, it's a desire for life.</p>

***The Psychology of Money*** by Morgan Housel

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">Some people are born into families that encourage educations; others are against it. some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself. </p>

***Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!*** by Robert T. Kiyosaki

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">The world pushes people around not because other people are bullies, but because the individual lacks internal controls and discipline. People who lack internal fortitude often becomes victims of those who have self discipline.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are: 1. Management of cash flow. 2. Management of people. 3. Management of personal time.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">Money can buy many things, but nothing more valuable than your freedom.</p>

***One Up On Wall Street: How To Use What You Already Know To Make Money In The Market*** by Peter Lynch

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">It's also important to be able to make decisions without complete or perfect information. Things are almost never clear on Wall Street, or when they are, then it's too late to profit from them. The scientific mind that needs to know all the data will be thwarted here.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">When E.F. Hutton talks, everybody is supposed to be listening, but that's just the problem. Everybody ought to be trying to fall asleep. When it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here is not listening, it's snoring. The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn't changed.</p>
